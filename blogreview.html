        <h1>Unit 1</h1>

        <h2>Outcome 2</h2>

        <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello 
        </h2>
<p>When building a website from scratch, it is important to know and understand how all required IT tools works to achieve a successful website. Such tools are Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Git and Github.
        Visual Studio Code is a source code editor that has built in support for Javascript, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)etc, this editor runs on different types of desktop, Windows and IOS. 
        </p>
        <p>I am happy with the use of VSCode because it has being useful having all codes and text needed to build my website all in one place as there is no need to be moving files from one code editor to another. It also makes saving(backup) easy just by linking VScode to Git and Github.
            </p>

<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate e.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello
    </h2>
    <p>These tools were appropriate for building my blog because it was dependable for it easy customisation and keyboard shortcuts on VSCode that makes it perfect for day-to-day use, which made it less time fiddling with my work, and more time to bring my ideas to life. Whereas the use of Trello as been a helpful platform to plan and organise my blog, from  listing and keeping track of to-do lists.
        </p>

<h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project. Are you happy with your website? 
        Why? 
        Why not? 
        You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
        </h2>
        <p>I am 50% satisfied because if I had not come for this course to learn about coding, I do not see myself building a website from scratch. Although my blog might look simple but i like things in moderation, also i considered making  it easy for others to read and not too much links so they don't get bored when visiting my blog. <br> However, if had more skills and time there is a higher percentage i would have made it better (professionally). 
</p>
<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project?
</h2> 
<p>Implement more Calls-to-Action button on the number references and other links:  so that users can go to the next step if they decide to do so. <br>Do more research on coding functions so that i can add more style to my blog and never stop testing. <br>Talk with other students to discover and figure out the problems I'm facing creating my blog to get it solved. 
 </p>

 <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose Check the assignment brief for all the ‘doing’ points.
    </h2>
<p>After the successful completion of creating my blog using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), I was constantly checking that all functions are error free from each section to fit purpose of what i have been asked to do.I believe all the functions are working well with no errors.
    </p>

    <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? 
        </h2>
    <h3>The following were used to create my blog:-
        </h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trello:-  This high-tech as served as a whiteboard for me but in a digital form. A benefit of Trello is that it’s mobile friendly as it available on mobile apps for easy access on the move which means I can update my board at any time. I have been able to use this to customise individual task list and boardcards to follow and to keep me informed of any changes I have made.  For example easy upload from other files like google docs. </li>
       <li> Slack:- the use of slack is great as for central platform through which teams communicate. But the downside of it is the constant incoming messages and notifications can get really overwhelming. Even though a private page can be created, it is possible  to accidentally send project(s) to the wrong group or person. I didn't use this tool for this project as I don't have the use for it. 
        </li>
        <li>Other tool used are VSCode and Mac.</li>
                 </ul>
                </p>

<h2> 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
    </h2>
<p>Remove/Minimize distraction e.g mobile phone:- by putting my phone on silent and muting all chat applications before starting on my work. <br>

        Track and limit how much time I spend on each task. I could use Trello for this, but it would be useful to track my time outside of Trello as well.<br>
        Give up on the illusion of perfection:- instead of wasting time for perfection i will do my work (blog) to the best of my knowledge and ability. However if there was enough time at hand i will go back and improve on it.
        </p>
<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? 
    </h2>
    <p>If there's an opportunity to do this work again, I will prefer to work in a team (although creating the website on my own as given an insight of how to develop a website from scratch) because tasks can be split between the teams to get more work done effectively. The use of slack will make it efficient for other people to assist each other.
        </p>

<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions 
            </h2>
<p>As important as digital testing is, it can also be challenging because software development process can take several months to a year depending on what will be created. Digital Testing is very important because it is an essential component of software testing development to look for bugs, make sure all functions are working.  While creating my blog, I had to keep testing to make sure all link functions are working to avoid having blank or not found page(s).
