        <h1>Unit 1</h1>

        <h2>Outcome 2</h2>

        <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello 
        </h2>
<p>When building a website from scratch, it is important to know and understand how all required IT tools works to achieve a successful website. Such tools are Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Git and Github.
        Visual Studio Code is a source code editor that has built in support for Javascript, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)etc, this editor runs on different types of desktop, Windows and IOS. 
        </p>
        <p>I am happy with the use of VSCode because it has being useful having all codes and text needed to build my website all in one place as there is no need to be moving files from one code editor to another. It also makes saving(backup) easy just by linking VScode to Git and Github.
            </p>

<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate e.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello
    </h2>
    <p>These tools were appropriate for building my blog because it was dependable for it easy customisation and keyboard shortcuts on VSCode that makes it perfect for day-to-day use, which made it less time fiddling with my work, and more time to bring my ideas to life. Whereas the use of Trello as been a helpful platform to plan and organise my blog, from  listing and keeping track of to-do lists.
        </p>

<h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project. Are you happy with your website? 
        Why? 
        Why not? 
        You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
        </h2>
        <p>I am 50% satisfied because if I had not come for this course to learn about coding, I do not see myself building a website from scratch. Although my blog might look simple but i like things in moderation, also i considered making  it easy for others to read and not too much links so they don't get bored when visiting my blog. <br> However, if had more skills and time there is a higher percentage i would have made it better (professionally). 
</p>
<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project?
</h2> 
<p>Implement more Calls-to-Action button on the number references and other links:  so that users can go to the next step if they decide to do so. <br>Do more research on coding functions so that i can add more style to my blog and never stop testing. <br>Talk with other students to discover and figure out the problems I'm facing creating my blog to get it solved. 
 </p>
