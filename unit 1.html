            </p>
        <p>Ability to Adapt and Problem-solving: for example group work. Where a member of a team is absent the other members of the team must carry on with the tasks, either by sharing the missing work among themselves or appoint another team member to get the job.

<p>The above skills listed earlier are also essential to this section. However, it is advisable to always have a to do list where one can write down / list (e.g Trello, Slack) what will be needed to complete a task or project, by doing so one will not miss out on the most important things. Trello is a web based to do listing that helps with organising a project. 
        Meanwhile slack a collaboration hub [8] that makes communication easy especially for team(s) to work together and get things done because channels are created for communication as a group or privately via “direct messaging[7].

    </p>

    <p>According to smallbixtrends.com, trello is a collaboration tool that gives you a visual overview of what is being worked on, who is working on it, and how far they’ve gotten. The tool organises person’s or team projects into boards, cards and lists[5].
        </p>
    
<p>I will be using trello and slack effectively when building my website project because it will help me with my visual tracking, planning, checklist and to keep track of my progress.

    <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>

    <h3>The following list might impact digital project:- </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Hacking </li>
        <li>Unskilled </li>
        <li>No great internet</li> 
        <li>Software Update</li>
        <li>Timing</li>      
        <li>Backup</li>  
        <li>Lose</li>  
        <li>Team Member</li> 
    </ul>

    <p>Unskilled Knowledge: A lack of skills on one operating system could be a risk. The use of Mac can be a high risk to person who is used to PC, then given a Mac to use will find it challenging because it is not what they are used to.
        </p>
    <p>Software update is another high risk because if a project is not backed up or a new release of a software version can  lead to missing project.
            </p>

<h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes (How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control?)
    </h2>
    <p>The use of Trello has help me organise and manage my project (group work, website) effectively because the visual boards are flexible, and let me list a ton of ideas and details into each card. 

            The use of Git and Github to save my work when coding are another great files because the git system helps keep track of my entire project history files[6], whereas github is a web-based that controls git where developer network to share their codes or issues they are facing when coding and possible employment form from a recruiters[6].

<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects - How does GDPR impact digital projects?
    </h2>
