       <ul>
           <li>Time Management</li>
           <li>Copywriting & Editing
            </li>
            <li>Problem-Solving</li>

            <li>Presentation Skills
                    </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Time management skills are very important for most people, but to successfully complete a project it is crucial for a person to manage their time effectively and be well organised by prioritizing tasks either personally or in a team[4].
            </p>
        <p>Ability to Adapt and Problem-solving: for example group work. Where a member of a team is absent the other members of the team must carry on with the tasks, either by sharing the missing work among themselves or appoint another team member to get the job.
            </p>
     
<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website (How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.
</h2>

<p>The above skills listed earlier are also essential to this section. However, it is advisable to always have a to do list where one can write down / list (e.g Trello, Slack) what will be needed to complete a task or project, by doing so one will not miss out on the most important things. Trello is a web based to do listing that helps with organising a project. 
        Meanwhile slack a collaboration hub [8] that makes communication easy especially for team(s) to work together and get things done because channels are created for communication as a group or privately via “direct messaging[7].

    </p>

    <p>According to smallbixtrends.com, trello is a collaboration tool that gives you a visual overview of what is being worked on, who is working on it, and how far they’ve gotten. The tool organises person’s or team projects into boards, cards and lists[5].
        </p>
    
<p>I will be using trello and slack effectively when building my website project because it will help me with my visual tracking, planning, checklist and to keep track of my progress.
