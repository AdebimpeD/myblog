    <h1>Unit 2</h1>

    <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page
        </h2>
    <p>I have made my website simple, easy to navigate and easy reading for any visiting user(s) as a good layout will keep users on the site because information can be easily accessed. I have used different layout and content by creating different elements like Home Page, About Me, Unit 1 and 2 etc.. that can be changed which means that users can easily switch between sections. The landing page on the website has a welcome message and then you click on the links navbar to see the content. On each page, I have highlighted each questions and answered all the questions in the assignment briefs, and laid out in a easy-to-read format.
        </p>
    <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h2>

 <p>Copyright is referred to as the legal protection of original works of authorship. Copyright protection on a website is for the content on a site provided that the work is original<a href = "https://www.zdnet.com/article/gdpr-its-here-so-what-happens-now/" target="_blank">[10],</a>owned by the applicant and it is clearly stated. The UK copyright act, Designs and Patents Act 1988, protects original creations involving literary work, written, dramatic, artistic, musical, and other types of creative expression<a href ="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/website-copyright-law/"target="_blank">[11].</a>        For example illegal downloads and infringement affects website. 
    </p>

    <p>Illegal downloads as cost many musicians, authors and other creative professionals lose millions due to download and upload of copyrighted material, such as books, songs and movies without the explicit permission of the copyright holder <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-copyright-laws-web-57441.html"target="_blank">[13].</a> So it is advisable to get permission before the use of any material that isn't ones or make a reference to them when used to avoid being sued or work taken down.
    </p>


<h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account (Describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them)
</h2>
<p>The web can be easily accessed by ordinary people but when it comes to disabled people they are faced with various challenges accessing the internet e.g. visually impaired <a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/29/disabled-people-internet-extra-costs-commission-scope" target= "_blank">  [14].</a>Visually impaired people face these challenges due to lack of compatibility and accessibility of web content with the screen reader they use or are used to <a href ="https://www.disabled-world.com/disability/accessibility/websitedesign/tech-challenge.php" target="_blank">[15],</a>but if a software application that provide computer-synthesized speech output can appear on the screen can be an advantage to them. 
</p>


<h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites?
</h2>
<p>Website consists of many files: text content, code, stylesheets, media content, images etc. When building a website, assembling files into structure onto a computer, it is important all contents are working and looking right before it eventually uploaded onto the server. The use of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) file is most commonly used to create a website. HTML is a computer language devised that allows website creation as it has code-words and syntax like any other language<a href ="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html"target="_blank">[16].</a>This language file will be used to create my blog.
</p>
<h3>Some of the following steps will be applied to create the blog:
</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Index.html:-</li></b>
This file will generally contain homepage content, that is, the text and images that people will see when they first visit the site. Using a text editor to create a new file called index.html and save it in test-site folder.
 <li><b>Images folder:-</li></b>This folder will contain all the images required for the site.</li>
 <li><b>Styles folder:- </li></b>This folder will contain the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) code to style the content e.g. setting text ,  background colors etc
