    <h1>Welcome To Adebimpe's Blog</h1>
    <h3>About Me </h3>

    <p>Welcome and thank you for visiting my blog today.
    </p>

    <p>My name is Adebimpe Dauda, I am 32 years old, mum of 2 to a beautiful girl and a boy. I was born in Nigeria and moved to the UK when I was 18, in 2005.  I am a graduate of  Liverpool John Moore University where I studied Accounting and finance. I currently work for Monsoon Accessorize as a sales assistant, I have been working for this company for the last 5 years.

<p>At the moment, I'm taking a code course at <a href = "https://wearecodenation.com/"class = "links"> Code Nation</a> you should also check them out. I am taking this course because it pop up on when searching for free courses to take in manchester as i wanted to learn something new. I must say the course is  interesting, changeling and sightful too because I have gained knowledge i won't have thought i would benefit from, by knowing how mobile apps are built and creating a website from scratch.

</p>

<p>In addition, I am a proud jewellery designer and running it as a small side hustle at the moment but would love to run it and other businesses as a personal full time job. My interest for jewellery making started when i visited Nigeria in 2012 after I graduated from university for a charity work. While doing my charity work, I took an interest in jewelry making and took a private class and since then I haven't stopped.
